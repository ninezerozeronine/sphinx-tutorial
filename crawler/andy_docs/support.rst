Support
=======

The easiest way to get some help with the project is to join the ``#crawler`` channel on `Freenode`_. Developers are there and you can ask questions to get help with the project. Another good way is to open an issue on `Github`_

The mailinglist at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crawler 
is also available for support.
